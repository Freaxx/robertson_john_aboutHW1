	<h2>Let me tell you a little about how I came to be.</h2>
	<p>My entire life I've kind of just been jerked around. I've never stayed in the same spot for over a year and a half. Being a child of a military father and my parents having been divorced 2 months before I came out of the womb, I used to think my brother was my father and I used to call him dad until I was 7 because no one cared enough to tell me otherwise. Upon becoming 7 I met my father for the first time and found out that my household wasn't apparently a healthy one and was shuffled out from Woodstock Virginia to Manassas Virginia to live with my Dad. He was married to a new woman, who shall not be named, and she didn't take too kindly to me so I was told to not leave my room. So I didn't, I stayed in my room or got out of the house and nothing else. I played video games my entire life to find some type of joy in my life because interacting with others didn't work out too well for me because I was just scared of everything. For 10 years I lived with that woman and only made eye contact with her a handful of times. I moved out when I was 17 because I got a phone call from my brother in afghanistan and he told me that I'm going to be a broken human being if I don't leave yet another unhealthy living situation. He sent me 500$ and I lived on the streets for about 3 months till I reconnected with an old friend and he gave me a place to live if I just paid half the rent starting the month after.</p>

	<p>I did manual labor for about 2 years after that and then even he tried to screw me over so I knew that no matter what for all the places I lived in America nothing ever seemed to work out. That's when I saw a beautiful woman over a webcam from this guy who I used to play games with. I instantly fell in love with her and devoted the next year moving to Canada. If theres one thing about me that I actual like, its that if I want to do something, I do it. So i did, I packed my stuff, applied for college and moved up here and married her. I am now 24 years old and couldn't be happier. I started taking the interactive media design program because I think I see a bigger picture for design and I'd really like to be able to put my ideas into practice. With the teachers help at Fanshawe College I really think I can make an impact in this field. I am a bit caught off guard because this is the first time in this program where I don't get the subject matter instantly, but with every other struggle I've faced in life I've overcome it by just putting in the effort and that is not going to change now. Oh yeah, Tectone is my username for video games and that name means alot to me, but thats a totally different story for another time.</p>
